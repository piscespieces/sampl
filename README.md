Sampl is still under construction but it can be launched locally

- Clone repository from GitHub
- Within the root directory run `bundle install` and `yarn install` to install all dependencies needed
- Create the database and run the migration files with `bin/rails db:create db:migrate`
- Run the `seeds.rb` file to seed the database with a `User` that can create `SamplePacks` â€” `bin/rails db:seed`
- Run the project in `localhost:3000` â€” If you want to launch the app in a different port, change the port number in the `Procfile.dev`
- Login, and have fun.
